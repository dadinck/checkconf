checkconf is a light configuration checker for C languages. It will check

-Header files
-functions/macros
-libraries

The default configuration files given with the distribution will check the usual 
libraries, defines, and headers.

Compiling the code should be straight forward

cc checkconf.c -o checkconf

Then run.

./checkconf

It should automatically pick up the proper check file for your system. If a different
check file is desired, that can be entered as an argument (on some OS's).
